# Actual Projects
 
This is where I keep actual, in-progress projects that aren't exercises.

## NaNoWriMo Bot
[NaNoWriMo Bot](https://github.com/powershellfish/Actual-Projects/blob/main/NaNoWriMo.py)
This program asks the user for their current wordcount, then the date. It compares this information against the estimated target wordcount to reach completion by the end of the month. If the user is below target, the program lets them know by how much, and encourages them to continue. If they have met or exceeded the target for that day, it congratulates them and encourages them. Because who doesn't like a high-five?

## Random Restaurant/Restaurant Chooser
[Restaurant Chooser](https://github.com/powershellfish/Actual-Projects/blob/main/random_restaurant.py) 
This program randomly generates a restaurant choice based on what has been stored in the program. The options can be modified, and the code can be repurposed as a "dice roller". The program was written with the intent of randomly selecting a restaurant so the user doesn't have to, and so the user can be provided with some healthy randomization.
